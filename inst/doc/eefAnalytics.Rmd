Title: Robust Analytical Methods for Evaluating Educational Interventions using Randomised Controlled Trials Designs
Description: eefAnalytics provides tools for analysing data from evaluations of educational interventions using a randomised controlled trial designs. It provides analytical tools to perform sensitivity analysis using different methods(e.g. frequentist models with bootstrapping and permutations options, Bayesian models). The functions contained in this package can be used for simple individual randomised trials, cluster randomised trials and multisite trials. The methods can also be used more widely beyond education trials. This package can be used to evaluate other interventions designs using Frequentist and Bayesian multilevel models.

# `crtBayes`: Bayesian analysis of cluster randomised education trials using Vague Priors.

## Description


 `crtBayes` performs analysis of cluster randomised education trials using a multilevel model under a Bayesian setting,
 assuming vague priors.


## Usage

```r
crtBayes(
  formula,
  random,
  intervention,
  adaptD = NULL,
  nsim = 2000,
  data,
  threshold = 1:10/10,
  ...
)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```formula```     |     the model to be analysed is of the form y ~ x1+x2+.... Where y is the outcome variable and Xs are the independent variables.
```random```     |     a string variable specifying the "clustering variable" as contained in the data. See example below.
```intervention```     |     a string variable specifying the "intervention variable" as appearing in the formula and the data. See example below.
```adaptD```     |     As this function uses rstanarm, this term provides the target average proposal acceptance probability during Stan’s adaptation period. Default is NULL.
```nsim```     |     number of MCMC iterations per chain. Default is 2000.
```data```     |     data frame containing the data to be analysed.
```threshold```     |     a scalar or vector of pre-specified threshold(s) for estimating Bayesian posterior probability such that the observed effect size is greater than or equal to the threshold(s).
```...```     |     additional arguments of [`stan_lmer`](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_glmer.html) to be passed to the function.

# `ComparePlot`: A plot function to compare different eefAnalytics S3 objects from the eefAnalytics package.

## Description


 It generates bar plot that compares the effect size from eefAnalytics' methods.


## Usage

```r
ComparePlot(
  eefAnalyticsList,
  group = NULL,
  Conditional = TRUE,
  ES_Total = TRUE,
  modelNames = NULL
)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```eefAnalyticsList```     |     A list of eefAnalytics S3 objects from eefAnalytics package.
```group```     |     a scalar value indicating which intervention to plot. This must not be greater than the number of intervention groups excluding the control group. For a two arm trial, the maximum value is 1 and a maximum value of 2 for three arm trial.
```Conditional```     |     a logical value to indicate whether to plot conditional effect size. The default is Conditional=TRUE, otherwise Conditional=FALSE should be specified for plot based on unconditional effect size. Conditional variance is total or residual variance a multilevel model with fixed effects, whilst unconditional variance is total variance or residual variance from a multilevel model with only intercept as fixed effect.
```ES_Total```     |     A logical value indicating whether to plot the effect size based on total variance or within school variance. The default is ES_Total=TRUE, to plot effect size using total variance. ES_Total=FALSE should be specified for effect size based on within school or residuals variance.
```modelNames```     |     a string factor containing the names of model to compare. See examples below.

## Details


 `ComparePlot` produces a bar plot which compares the effect sizes and the associated confidence intervals from the different models.
 For a multilevel model, it shows the effect size based on residual variance and total variance.


## Value


 Returns a bar plot to compare the different methods.

 # `plot.eefAnalytics`: A plot method for an eefAnalytics S3 object obtained from the eefAnalytics package.

## Description


 Plots different figures based on output from eefAnalytics package.


## Usage

```r
plot(x, group = NULL, Conditional = TRUE, ES_Total = TRUE, slop = FALSE, ...)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
```x```     |     an output object from the eefAnalytics package.
```group```     |     a scalar value indicating which intervention to plot. This must not be greater than the number of intervention groups excluding the control group. For a two arm trial, the maximum value is 1 and a maximum value of 2 for three arm trial.
```Conditional```     |     a logical value to indicate whether to plot the conditional effect size. The default is Conditional=TRUE, otherwise Conditional=FALSE should be specified for plot based on the unconditional effect size. Conditional variance is total or residual variance from a multilevel model with fixed effects, whilst unconditional variance is total variance or residual variance from a multilevel model with only intercept as fixed effect.
```ES_Total```     |     A logical value indicating whether to plot the effect size based on total variance or within school variance. The default is ES_Total=TRUE, to plot the effect size using total variance. ES_Total=FALSE should be specified for the effect size based on within school or residuals variance.
```slop```     |     A logical value indicating whether to return the plot of random intercept (default is slop=FALSE). return other school-by-intervention interaction random slope (s) is slop=TRUE. This argument is suitable only for mstBayes and mstFREQ functions.
```...```     |     arguments passed to [`plot.default`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html)

## Details


 Plot produces a graphical visualisation depending on which model is fitted:
  

*  For `srtFREQ()` , plot can only be used when `nBoot` or `nPerm` is specified to visualise the distribution of bootstrapped or permutated values. 

*  For `crtFREQ()` or `mstFREQ()` , plot shows the distribution of random intercepts when `group=NULL` . It produces histogram of permutated or bootstrapped values when `group` is specified and either `nBoot` or `nPerm` is also specified. 


## Value


 Returns relevant plots for each model.
