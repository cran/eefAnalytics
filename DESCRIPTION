Title: Robust Analytical Methods for Evaluating Educational
        Interventions using Randomised Controlled Trials Designs
Description: The eefAnalytics provides tools for analysing data from evaluations of educational interventions using a randomised controlled trial designs. It provides analytical tools to perform sensitivity analysis using different
    methods(e.g. frequentist models with bootstrapping and permutations options, Bayesian models). The functions contained in this package can be used for simple individual randomised trials, cluster randomised trials and multisite trials.
    The methods can also be used more widely beyond education trials. This package can be used to evaluate other interventions designs using Frequentist and Bayesian multilevel models.
