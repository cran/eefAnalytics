\title{Bayesian Analysis of Simple Randomised Education Trials (SRT) using Bayesian Linear Regression Model with Vague Priors.}
\usage{
srtBayes(
  formula,
  intervention,
  baseln,
  nsim = 2000,
  data,
  alpha = 0.05,
  digits = 3,
  threshold = 1:10/10,
  condopt,
  uncopt,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{The model to be analysed is of the form y~x1+x2+.... Where y is the outcome variable and Xs are the independent variables.}

\item{intervention}{A string variable specifying the "intervention variable" as appearing in the formula and the data. See example below.}

\item{baseln}{A string variable allowing the user to specify the reference category for intervention variable. When not specified, the first level will be used as a reference.}

\item{nsim}{number of MCMC iterations per chain. Default is 2000.}

\item{data}{Data frame containing the data to be analysed.}

\item{alpha}{significant level, default alpha = 0.05.}

\item{digits}{number of decimal places, by default digits=3}

\item{threshold}{a scalar or vector of pre-specified threshold(s) for estimating Bayesian posterior probability such that the observed effect size is greater than or equal to the threshold(s).}

\item{condopt}{additional arguments of \code{\link[R2jags]{jags}} to be passed only to the conditional model specification (for example, defining priors only for the conditional model, etc.).}

\item{uncopt}{additional arguments of \code{\link[R2jags]{jags}} to be passed only to the unconditional model specification (for example, defining priors only for the unconditional model, etc.).}

\item{...}{Common additional arguments of \code{\link[R2jags]{jags}} to be passed to both the conditional and unconditional model specifications}
}
\value{
S3 object; a list consisting of
\itemize{
\item \code{Beta}: Estimates and credible intervals for the variables specified in the model. Use \code{summary.eefAnalytics} to get Rhat and effective sample size for each estimate.
\item \code{ES}: Conditional Hedges' g effect size and its 95\% credible intervals.
\item \code{sigma2}: Residual variance.
\item \code{ProbES}: A matrix of Bayesian posterior probabilities such that the observed effect size is greater than or equal to a pre-specified threshold(s).
\item \code{Model}: A model object from \code{\link[R2jags]{jags}} and an \code{\link[MCMCvis]{MCMCsummary}} object containing only the mean and credible intervals (CIs) as columns.
\item \code{Unconditional}: A list of unconditional effect sizes, sigma2 and ProbES obtained based on residual variance from the unconditional model (model with only the intercept as a fixed effect).

}
\description{
\code{srtBayes} performs Bayesian multilevel analysis of Simple Randomised Education Trials (SRT), utilising vague priors
and JAGS language to fit the model.
This can also be used with schools as fixed effects.
